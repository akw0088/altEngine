This tool I wrote a long time ago to convert wavefront obj files into gpu hardware friendly files

.ibo is just all the index buffers
.vbo is just all the vertices used by the index buffer

I dont load md3 files directly, but use a model converter (milkshape3d) to import the md3 and export it as a wavefront model with the texture mapped
